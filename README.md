# Project2
 List Pagination and Filtering

In this project, I will use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

I will start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. I will write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

While making these improvements, I will use the principle of "progressive enhancement." The page should still display the students' names without JavaScript turned on, but will be much improved (enhanced) with the JavaScript programming you add. In other words, I will add JavaScript to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript is required to use the web page.
